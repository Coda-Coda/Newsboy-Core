# Newsboy-Core

With a quick browser through Github, one can find many virtual assisstants - [Melissa](https://github.com/Melissa-AI/Melissa-Core), [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis), [Athena](https://github.com/rcbyron/hey-athena-client), and some [nameless ones](https://github.com/brmson/Personal-Assistant). With such a wealth of other great projects to choose from, why make this one? For one, because making it is fun. But more importantly, there are some things that (I believe) set this one apart:

- Many other projects require an internet connection for NLU or speech recognition. While you have the option to use online services, nothing requires an internet connection, so it can work in your car
- Other projects that don't use online services seems to have a fairly simple way of responding. Newsboy is capable of probing for information no matter what the modules enable him to do
- You can have multiple 'clients' connected to Newsboy, which means you can connect to him from other computers (and more importantly, he can have multiple control panels around the house)
- We have taken a very modular approach, so it is fairly easy to add new ways to connect to him, new users, and to add new modules. In fact, he even has his own package manager!

(Note that at this stage, he is not yet functional)
